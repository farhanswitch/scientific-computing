# Scientific Computing Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of key algorithms commonly used in Scientific Computing, written purely in Python 3. No external libraries or dependencies are required.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Finding Square Root using Bisection Method**  
   An efficient method for calculating square roots by iteratively narrowing down the interval where the root lies.

2. **Gauss-Seidel Method for Solving Linear Equations**  
   An iterative technique for solving a system of linear equations, commonly used when dealing with large sparse systems.

3. **Newton Polynomial Table Generator**  
   A method for constructing the Newton interpolation polynomial, useful for numerical interpolation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no additional libraries needed)

## How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. To run an algorithm, simply execute the corresponding script:

```bash
python3 <algorithm_file>.py
```
